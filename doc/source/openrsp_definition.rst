OpenRSP Definitions
===================

The following definitions will be used through the OpenRSP library
and documentation:

#) Perturbation pattern: a combination of several perturbations specified
   by their labels (as integers), where the same perturbations will always
   be consecutive.

   The order of perturbations in the pattern will be the same as that given
   by the host program---the ``pert_labels`` given in the function
   :py:meth:`OpenRSPSetPerturbations`.

#) Perturbation tuple: an ordered list of perturbation patterns.
