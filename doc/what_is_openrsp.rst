What is OpenRSP?
================

OpenRSP is a program library that uses recursive routines to identify and
assemble contributions to response properties - that is, molecular properties
as they are expressed in the theory called "response theory" from theoretical chemistry.

The name of OpenRSP reflects the following features:

* It is a library for the **Open**-ended calculation of **R**\ e\ **SP**\ onse properties: It
  can be used for the calculation of reponse properties to arbitrary order.
* It is **Open**-source and `is publicly available <https://github.com/openrsp/openrsp>`_  under the LGPL v2.1 license.
* It has an application programming interface that **Open**\ s it to connection with other programs
  that wish to make use of its functionality.


What are response properties?
-----------------------------

Response properties describe how fundamental properties of a molecular system *respond* 
to external influences like subjection to an electromagnetic field or displacement of the atomic nuclei.
They and related properties are essential for the description of spectroscopic processes
and molecular characteristics like infrared spectroscopy, Raman scattering, multiphoton absorption
and vibrational energy levels. If you have ever done computational work on the molecular level
for phenomena in this category, chances are that response properties were involved at some
stage of the calculation.

Response properties can be categorized by their *order*, that is, the "number of influences"
that were taken into consideration for a given property. The first such order is called
*linear response* and contains much-used properties like the electric dipole polarizability - i.e.
the first-order change to the molecular dipole moment in the presence of an electric field - or
the Hessian matrix of nuclear geometric displacements - i.e. the change in the molecular gradient
that would result from displacing each coordinate of the molecular geometry.

Higher orders of response properties describe the changes that the fundamental molecular property
would undergo upon subjection to more than one external influence, or upon higher-order interactions with
the same influence. Examples of such properties are the geometric gradient of the electric dipole
polarizability - essential for the description of vibrational Raman spectra - or the cubic and quartic
force constants, i.e. the third- and fourth-order derivatives of the molecular energy with respect to
geometrical displacements - which may be used to calculate corrections to a description of the vibrational
energy levels stemming from the geometric Hessian.

Why use OpenRSP?
----------------

By its recursive structure, OpenRSP makes it possible to calculate response
properties of arbitrary complexity in an analytical manner, not resorting 
to numerical schemes like finite difference methods in the calculation. Compared to
analytical methods, numerical approaches may be associated with a
greater degree of uncertainty related to accuracy and practical feasibility of
the calculation, and we therefore think that analytical calculation should be used
whenever it is practical. 

Today's programs written for the calculation of response properties either do
not have a recursive structure, or they use numerical methods to different
extents, or both. In the cases where existing programs use an analytical
approach, they are either not recursive (which typically means that a new
program routine must be written for each new property for which calculation is
desired), or they can only be used for a limited category of properties. 
As the complexity of the expressions that must be evaluated in an analytical approach
to yield the desired response property increases rapidly with the order of 
response, such analytic calculation of high-order response properties can
quickly become a very complicated task and the implementation of *ad hoc* program
routines for their calculation may be intractable at higher orders.

The structure of OpenRSP, using recursion as a core tool, solves the task of 
identifying and assembling contributions to response properties "once and for all".
When combined with program libraries that can provide the contributions that 
OpenRSP identifies, any response property can be calculated fully analytically 
as long as those libraries can provide the necessary contributions.
