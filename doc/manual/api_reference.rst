API Reference
=============

In order to use OpenRSP, C users should first include the header file
of OpenRSP in their codes::

  #inclde "OpenRSP.h"

while Fortran users should use the OpenRSP module::

  use OpenRSP_f

In this chapter, we will describe all the functions defined in OpenRSP
API for users. These functions should be invoked as::

  ierr = OpenRSP...(...)

where ``ierr`` contains the error information. Users should check if
it equals to ``QSUCCESS`` (constant defined in
`QcMatrix library <https://gitlab.com/bingao/qcmatrix>`_). If not, there
was error happened in the invoked function, and the calculations should
stop.

.. _section_fortran_convention:

Functions of OpenRSP API (Fortran version)
------------------------------------------

Functions of OpenRSP API (Fortran) are similar to those of the C version, except
that an extra ``_f`` should be appended to each function. Other differences are
the (ii) argument types and (iii) callback functions (subroutines for Fortran).
The latter will be described in Chapter :ref:`chapter_callback_functions`. The
former relates to the convention of types in Fortran, please refer to the manual
of `QcMatrix library <https://gitlab.com/bingao/qcmatrix>`_ and the following
table for the convention:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Type in OpenRSP
     - Fortran
   * - ``struct OpenRSP``
     - ``type(OpenRSP)``
   * - ``QVoid* user_ctx``
     - ``type(C_PTR) user_ctx``
   * - callback functions
     - external subroutines

We also want to mention that users can also pass their own defined Fortran type
as the user-defined callback function context to OpenRSP, by encapsulated into
the ``type(C_PTR) user_ctx``.
