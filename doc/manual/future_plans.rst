Future Plans
============

Here are some plans for the next release or even later stage.

* Change or abandon literate programming approach (because of extra work on
  maintenance and further development)
* Add more unit tests (currently only polarizability)
* Change API codes to C++
* Add Fortran unit testing
* Implement symbolic computations (see :ref:`section_symbolic_computations`)
* Implement perturbation free scheme (see :ref:`section_perturbation_free`)
* Add response theory based on molecular orbital coefficients and/or coupled cluster
