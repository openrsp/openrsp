A brief history
===============

The OpenRSP project has been under development since the mid-2000's, but did
not feature a recursive structure from the beginning. The development of the
approach used in today's recursive structure was started in the autumn of 2011,
and the first results (i.e. the first molecular properties calculated and
regarded as suitable for publication) were obtained about one year later (close
to the end of 2012/beginning of 2013).

Since then, we have worked on improving the functionality and developing a
version of the program ready for publication. This new work has for example
entailed making it possible to calculate other categories of properties
(so-called residues of response properties usable for the calculation of
multiphoton absorption strengths) and making OpenRSP modular - i.e. cleanly
separated from and more easily able communicate with other programs. We are
working towards releasing an official version of OpenRSP in 2018.
