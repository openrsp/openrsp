About the OpenRSP project
=========================

OpenRSP is a program for the open-ended calculation of response properties. It connects to response equation solution routines, routines for differentiated one-electron and two-electron integral contributions, and routines for exchange/correlation contributions to enable the calculation of response properties to arbitrary order. The program is not yet ready for public release.


Publications
============

Several projects where results were obtained using the OpenRSP program have already been carried out, and an overview will be posted.
