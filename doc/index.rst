OpenRSP: open-ended response theory
===================================

OpenRSP is a program for the open-ended calculation of response properties. It
connects to response equation solution routines, routines for differentiated
one-electron and two-electron integral contributions, and routines for
exchange/correlation contributions to enable the calculation of response
properties to arbitrary order. The program is not yet ready for public release.
