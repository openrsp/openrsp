What is OpenRSP?
================
.. include:: background.rst

OpenRSP is a computer library that uses recursive routines [#]_
to identify and assemble contributions to molecular properties
("response functions" or "residues") based on the density
matrix-based response theory [#]_.

Therefore, OpenRSP extensively bases on the matrix operations,
which are built on top of the `QcMatrix library <https://gitlab.com/bingao/qcmatrix>`_.
Please refer to the manual and tutorial of this library if you
are not familiar with it.

Ingredients needed by OpenRSP
=============================
.. include:: background.rst

Briefly, to use OpenRSP, one has to provide:

#. perturbations,
#. functions for evaluating overlap integrals,
#. different one-electron operators,
#. different two-electron operators,
#. different exchange-correlation functionals,
#. nuclear Hamiltonian,
#. linear response equation solver.

The reference state (usually the ground state), and excited states
(if calculating residues) are sent to OpenRSP APIs as input arguments.

.. include:: background.rst

Within the above ingredients, one does not need to provide both
one-electron operators, two-electron operators and exchange-correlation
functionals.

Indeed only one of them is needed for OpenRSP to calculate the electron
contributions to the response functions or residues. For instance, only
one- and two-electron operators are needed for the Hartree-Fock calculations.

One therefore only needs to provide OpenRSP the necessary operators
for their interested Hamiltonian.

Callback function scheme
========================
.. include:: background.rst

For the 7 ingredients, one has to provide OpenRSP appropriate callback
functions that will be invoked by OpenRSP during calculations, whenever the
following quantities needed

#. rank of a perturbation component,
#. (perturbed) overlap integrals,
#. (perturbed) one-electron operators,
#. (perturbed) two-electron operators,
#. (perturbed) exchange-correlation functionals,
#. (perturbed) nuclear Hamiltonian,
#. response parameters solved from the linear response equation.

.. include:: background.rst

The use of callback functions make one freely choose the appropriate
functions during runtime to calculate molecular properties.

Moreover, the use of callback function to determine the rank of a
perturbation component [#]_ makes OpenRSP a **perturbation free** library.

.. [#] Definition of perturbation component and rank in Section
       "**1.2 OpenRSP Notations and Conventions**" of OpenRSP Manual.

Perturbation free
=================
.. include:: background.rst

That is:

#. OpenRSP does not need to know the meaning of each perturbation.
   All perturbations are treated equally as symbols/variables in
   OpenRSP for differentiation.
#. Only the order of perturbation labels matters, that OpenRSP will
   follow to generate necessary perturbation tuples [#]_ during
   calculations.
#. These labels are sent to OpenRSP by the APIs :c:func:`OpenRSPGetRSPFun`
   or :c:func:`OpenRSPGetResidue` during runtime.

.. [#] Definition of perturbation label and tuple in Section
       "**1.2 OpenRSP Notations and Conventions**" of OpenRSP Manual.

OpenRSP Notations and Conventions
=================================
.. include:: background.rst

After the necessary ingredients properly provided, one can invoke OpenRSP
APIs :c:func:`OpenRSPGetRSPFun` or :c:func:`OpenRSPGetResidue` to calculate
response functions or residues.

In the following, we will first describe how to install OpenRSP and then how
to prepare the above ingredients respectively, and perform the calculations.

Before proceeding, to make yourself familiar with OpenRSP, please refer to
Section "**1.2 OpenRSP Notations and Conventions**" in the OpenRSP Manual
for the notations and conventions used through the OpenRSP library and
this tutorial.
