* Magnus Ringholm, Dan Jonsson and Kenneth Ruud, *J. Comput. Chem.* **35**, 622-633 (2014).
* [OpenRSP] OpenRSP, an open-ended response property library, www.openrsp.org

If the use of OpenRSP involved the calculation of single residues of response properties,
citation of the following reference is expected in addition to the references
