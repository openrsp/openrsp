Citation guide
==============

All published results obtained with OpenRSP are expected to cite the following
references:

* Magnus Ringholm, Dan Jonsson and Kenneth Ruud, *J. Comput. Chem.* **35**, 622-633 (2014).
* [OpenRSP] OpenRSP, an open-ended response property library, www.openrsp.org

If the use of OpenRSP involved the calculation of single residues of response
properties, citation of the following reference is expected in addition to the
references listed above:

Please also note that host programs into which OpenRSP is incorporated may have
their own citation guidelines or requirements to be observed if such programs
are used.
