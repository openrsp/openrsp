Theoretical background
======================

We are working on a documentation of the OpenRSP core routines and its application programming
interface (API), and this, together with a introduction of the underlying theory of OpenRSP 
intended to be accessible, will be made available on this website once ready.

In the meantime, for a technical explanation of the theoretical background of OpenRSP, the 
following references may prove informative:

The paper describing the version of response theory upon which OpenRSP is based.

Describes a recursive algorithmic approach for the calculation of response properties:

* Magnus Ringholm, Dan Jonsson and Kenneth Ruud, *J. Comput. Chem.* **35**, 622-633 (2014)

Describes a recursive algorithmic approach for the calculation of single residues of response functions that can be used to obtain multiphoton absorption matrix elements:

Describes a recursive algorithmic approach for the calculation of single residues of response functions that contain perturbations which affect the basis set (please note that this functionality is not yet implemented in the latest version of OpenRSP):

* Daniel H. Friese, Magnus Ringholm, Bin Gao and Kenneth Ruud, *J. Chem. Theory Comput.* **11** (10), 4814 (2015)
