run this test with
$ ../../runtest

then look in lda_he2.stdout
search for gradient = Eg

without grid weight derivatives you get:
-0.251809427267

with grid weight derivatives (default compilation):
-0.264970699078

correct result from finite-field:
-0.272717

note that the grid is horrible on purpose (14 radial, 14 angular points)
