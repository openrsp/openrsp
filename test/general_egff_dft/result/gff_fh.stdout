WARNING for ERROR  (Dalton program stopped with exit code 0)
- THEREFORE scratch directory /tmp/DALTON_scratch_bast/bast/gff_fh is not deleted
  by this script so you may restart the calculation, if possible
  ( /tmp/DALTON_scratch_bast/bast/gff_fh may be deleted by your queueing system )
- REMEMBER to delete /tmp/DALTON_scratch_bast/bast/gff_fh yourself !!!
