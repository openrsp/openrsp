!! Give future long- and short-term developments

Short-term:
* Adds nuclear contributions
* Adds DFT contributions
* Adds integrals and expectation values in callback functions?
* Gradually moves files in src/interfaces and src/input to DALTON
  and LSDALTON, and removes all other unused files/directories
* Prepares unit testing
* Prepares tutorial and finish documentation
* Adds the residue calculations
* Adds PCM and PE contributions (in host programs)

Long-term:
* Changes to perturbation free scheme
* Implements the symbolic operations
* Adds response theory based on molecular orbital coefficients? coupled cluster?
