!! Give future long- and short-term developments

Short-term
----------

#. Removes the frequency of perturbation a in OpenRSPGetRSPFun()
#. Adds nuclear contributions in tests
#. Adds DFT contributions in tests
#. Adds the API for residue calculations
#. Adds integrals and expectation values in callback functions?
#. Gradually moves files in src/interfaces and src/input to DALTON
   and LSDALTON, and removes/merges files in src/legacy and src/TODO
#. Prepares unit testing
#. Prepares tutorial and finish documentation
#. Adds PCM and PE contributions (in host programs)

Long-term
---------

#. Changes to perturbation free scheme
#. Implements the symbolic operations
#. Adds response theory based on molecular orbital coefficients? coupled cluster?
