* parallel calculations
  (1) This error stopped with "Segmentation fault" when doing SCF. More exactly, it
      stopped when (in subroutine HRFCK1, abacus/herdirect.F) making reduced density
      matrix for screening:

      CALL MKDRAO(DMAT,WORK(KDRAO),NDMAT,
     &            WORK(KFREE),LFREE,IPRINT)

      For Intel compiler ifort, this error could be fixed by adding option
      -heap-arrays during compilation. Explanation from Forums of Intel:

      "All Fortran compilers sometimes need to make temporary copies of arrays during runtime.
       Some compilers put those temporary data elements on the heap, some put it on the stack.
       Intel Fortran uses stack by default for array temporaries for performance reasons.
       Other compilers, like gfortran, use heap. It's just a simple matter of choice where
       you put them. Intel tries to default to the most efficient and fastest place to put
       them, which is stack."

      As regards gfortran, ??

* PCM calculations
* more spectroscopies
* two-electron code
* DFT calculations
* unrestricted calculations

* considering symmetry

* may change to call RSPCTL to solve linear set of response equations

* the code may only work for double precision

* matrix
* dalton subroutines
* minimum functionality
