There should be the following files:

interface_molecule.F90        basis set, coordinates
interface_xc.F90              exchange-correlation
interface_1el.F90             1el integrals, overlap matrix
interface_2el.F90             2el integrals
interface_rsp_solver.F90      response solver
interface_scf.F90             density and fock matrices
interface_f77_memory.F90      interface to the good old f77 work array
interface_io.F90              input and output

Program specifics should be minimized.  Using common blocks is convenient for
the quick hack but in the long term it is like nuclear waste.  Please always
think about others who are working on other codes where the infrastructure of
your code is simply not there.

Never access data directly, only through get functions.
