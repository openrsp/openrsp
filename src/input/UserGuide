Input file:

(1) You should use .RUN PROPERITES, .RUN RESPONSE, or .INTERFACE to
    let DALTON write SIRIFC file
(2) Add "*END OF" before "$RESPONS"
(3) Use .DIRECT and .PARALLEL
(4) Implemented keywords (MAXPHP and OPTORB only makes sense in MCSCF calculations):
    .MAX IT   : reads one more line for the maximum number of micro iterations
                in the iterative solution of the frequency independent linear
                response functions, default is 100
    .MAXPHP   : reads one more line for the maximum dimension of the sub-block
                of the configuration Hessian, default is 0
    .MAXRED   : read one more line for the maximum dimension of the reduced
                space to which new basis vectors are added, default is 400
    .THRESH   : reads one more line for the convergence threshold for the solution
                of the frequency-independent response equations, default is 1.0D-07
    .OPTORB   : uses optimal orbital trial vectors in the iterative solution of
                the frequency-dependent linear response equations, if given, default
                is not to use
    .FREQ     : reads one more line containing the number of real frequencies and
                the corresponding real frequencies, default is 1 real frequency, equals to zero
    .IMFREQ   : reads one more line containing the number of imaginary frequencies and
                the corresponding imaginary frequencies, default is 1 imaginary frequency,
                equals to zero
    .ROA      : calculates Raman optical activity (ROA) properties if given
    .CARS     : calculates coherent anti-Stokes Raman Scattering (CARS) if given
    .JONES    : calculates magnetoelectric Jones spectroscopy if given
    .POLARIZ  : calculates linear polarizability if given
    .HYPOLAR2 : calculates 1st hyperpolarizability using n+1 rule if given
    .VIBBETA  : calculates vibrational hyperpolarizability if given
