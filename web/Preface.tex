\section{Version Numbering Scheme\index{Version numbering scheme}}

The version numbering scheme used for \LibName is \textbf{Major.Minor.Patch},
where
\begin{description}
  \item[Major] generally represents new release containing important changes,
    and it may not be compatible with previous versions.
  \item[Minor] is changed when a few new features introduced, and it should be
    compatible with those of the same \textbf{Major} number.
  \item[Patch] usually includes bug fixes, and should be compatible with those
    of the same \textbf{Major.Minor} number.
\end{description}
