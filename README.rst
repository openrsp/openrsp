A brief description of the project
----------------------------------

OpenRSP is a computer program that uses recursive routines to identify
and assemble contributions to molecular properties ("response properties")
as they are formulated in the theory "response theory" which is used in
theoretical chemistry.

Please refer to ``doc/manual`` and ``doc/tutorial`` for more details.
