1. A brief description of the project.

   OpenRSP is a computer program that uses recursive routines to identify
   and assemble contributions to molecular properties ("response properties")
   as they are formulated in the theory "response theory" which is used in
   theoretical chemistry.

   Please refer to doc/manual.pdf for more details.

   Please refer to RULES if you would like to contribute.

   If you have used OpenRSP and found it is useful, please consider to cite the
   references in openrsp.bib.

3. Notes on the developer's build environment and potential portability problems.

   We could probably describe the implementation of OpenRSP library into DALTON
   and LSDALTON, and refer to the tutorial that we will prepare.
