1. A brief description of the project.

   This project is to implement Andreas J. Thorvaldsen's codes into DALTON
   main branch using its MO solver.

2. A pointer to the project website (if it has one)

3. Notes on the developer's build environment and potential portability problems.

   In order to implement Andreas J. Thorvaldsen's codes, we have modified the
   following files in DALTON main branch:

   (1) General files

       * configure
         adds options for F90 file
         adds -DBUILD_OPENRSP flag

       * Makefile
         adds "-Lopenrsp -lopenrsp" to "DALTON_LIBS",
         adds "OPENRSP_OBJ" to "MODULES",
         adds "openrsp" to "SUBDIRS",
         adds "OPENRSP_OBJ :
                 	cd openrsp && $(MAKE) all"

       * "abacus" directory
         + abarspn.F
           modifies subroutine RSPLLE to handle general GD vectors
         + dalgnr.F
           adds interface in subroutine EXEDRV
         + her1drv.F
           adds subroutines WRITE_DSOFSO and READ_DSOFSO, from linsca/abacus/her1drv.F

       * "include" directory
         + abainf.h
         + cbilnr.h
         + cbione.h
         + cbivib.h
         + dipole.h
         + dummy.h
         + energy.h
         + inflin.h
         + inforb.h
         + iratdef.h
         + inftab.h
         + infvar.h
         + moldip.h
         + mxcent.h
         + nuclei.h
         + priunit.h
         + quadru.h
         + wrkrsp.h
           by considering F90 format

       * "tools" directory
         + check_depend
           adds suffix F90

   (2) DFT calculations

       * We do not support DFT calculations for the time being :-(
       * "dft" directory
         + dft_aux.F
           add function DO_DFT() from linsca/dft/dft_aux.F

   (3) Geometirc derivatives

       * modifies abacus/her2ave.F based on that from linsca (see comments for details)
       * copies subroutine GRCONT from linsca/abacus/aba2tex.F
       * modifies all the subroutines having "CALL PARDRV" (aba2tex.F, abarhs.F, eri2par.F)

       * besides, we have also modified some subroutines (such as TWOINT, TWOODS, ...) in:
         + abacus/her2drv.F
         + abacus/herdirect.F
         + abacus/herdrv.F (also adds XYZ-ALL for CM-2 and QDBINT)
         + abacus/herpar.F (important modifications in subroutine HER_RVRES)
         with one more argument GENCNT (or GENCTR)

         These modifications may affect
         + some files in rsp directory (we need to modify them later!!)

       * modifies abacus/abafsd.F, abacus/her1pro.F, and cc/ccfndop.F for dipole gradient integrals

       * modifies abacus/her1pro.F, and cc/ccfndop.F for quadrupole gradients

   (4) Magnetic derivatives

       * abacus/her1pro.F, abacus/herdrv.F, abacus/her1int.F, and include/cbiher.h
         adds integrals S2MBRA, S2MKET, and S2MMIX, please see the comments

4. Important files and subdirectories in "openrsp"

   (1) Andreas J. Thorvaldsen's codes

        * matrix_genop.F90  : 
        * matrix_defop.F90  : 
        * prop_contribs.F90 : 
        * rsp_equations.F90 :
