# Contribution guidelines

## Other files with relevant information

* Authorship status and process for approval as OpenRSP author: https://github.com/openrsp/openrsp/blob/master/AUTHOR_STATUS_AND_DECISION_PROCESS.md
* Code of Conduct: https://github.com/openrsp/openrsp/blob/master/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
* OpenRSP's license: https://github.com/openrsp/openrsp/blob/master/LICENSE

## Statement of inclusivity

Participants in the OpenRSP project (henceforth "the project") pledge to adhere to an intention to act in an inclusive and welcoming manner towards other participants in the project and towards anyone wishing to become a participant in the project. This manner of conduct includes, but is not necessarily limited to, that which is described in the project's Code of Conduct referenced at the beginning of this document. Pledging to intend to act in this manner is a prerequisite for becoming a participant in the project.

## Responsibilites when contributing code to the project

Any person who submits changes to the OpenRSP repository, by opening a pull request or by other means, is responsible for and must confirm that they have taken the necessary steps to achieve the following:

* Ensure that every person who contributed to the contents of the submitted changes understands and agrees with 1) the contribution guidelines in this file, 2) the documents concerning contribution and authorship topics linked to herein and 3) terms dictated by the license (referenced at the beginning of this document) under which OpenRSP is released, and that every such person authorizes such submission under these terms.
* Communicate to the OpenRSP authors the names and contact information of every person who contributed to the submitted changes if such persons do not already have status as authors of OpenRSP.
* Ensure that none of the contents of the submitted changes are licensed under terms which conflict with OpenRSP's license terms.

## Status categories associated with the project

Making an accepted contribution to the master branch of OpenRSP - typically achieved upon the acceptance and completion of a merge following a pull request having the master branch as the target branch - grants status as an OpenRSP "contributor" to those that produced this contribution, without any further conditions for such approval, but does not automatically grant status as an OpenRSP "author". The process by which one may become an OpenRSP author is described in the "Authorship status and process for approval as OpenRSP author", which is referenced at the beginning of this document and which contains further clarifications of the categories of "author" and "contributor". The preferred way to initiate a request for consideration as author is to amend the AUTHORS.md file in a pull request with the names of the persons for which one wishes this petitioning process to be initiated.

# How to contribute

We welcome contributions from external contributors.
This document describes the contribution process: from proposing a change to
getting it merged into OpenRSP.
The process for contributing is exactly the same for the core development team
and for external contributors:

* Maintainers do not push directly to the repository.
* Maintainers do not review their own patches.
* Approval of one or more maintainers is sufficient for trivial patches.
  Trivial patches are typos and trivial bugfixes
* For any patch that is not trivial, two maintainers need to review and approve the patch.

## Getting Started

* Make sure you have a [GitHub account].
* [Fork] the [openrsp/openrsp] repository on GitHub.
* On your local machine, [clone] your fork of the OpenRSP repository.
* The [Psi4](http://psicode.org/) documentation has more detailed instructions for interacting with your fork which can be found
  [here](http://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/build_obtaining.html#faq-forkpsi4public).
  and [here](http://psicode.org/psi4manual/master/build_obtaining.html#faq-githubworkflow).

## Making Changes

* Add some really awesome code to your local fork. It's usually a [good idea] to
  make changes on a [branch] with the branch name relating to the feature you
  are going to add. A style guide is available in the [STYLE_GUIDE.md file].
* When you are ready for others to examine and comment on your new feature,
  navigate to your fork of OpenRSP on GitHub and open a [pull request] (PR)
  __towards the `master` branch__.
  Note that after you launch a PR from one of your fork's branches, all
  subsequent commits to that branch will be added to the open pull request
  automatically.
  Each commit added to the PR will be validated for mergeability, compilation
  and test suite compliance; the results of these tests will be visible on the
  PR page.
* The title of your pull request should be marked with `[WIP]` if itâ€™s a work
  in progress. Feel free to use as many labels as you think necessary!
* Update the [doc/changelog.rst](../doc/changelog.rst) file. We follow the conventions and recommendations detailed at
  [keepachangelog.com]
* When you're ready to be considered for merging, check the "Ready to go" box
  on the PR page to let the OpenRSP team know that the changes are complete.
  The code will not be merged until this box is checked, the continuous
  integration services return passing checkmarks, and maintainers give "Approved" reviews.

## Licensing

* We do not require any formal copyright assignment or contributor license agreement except for confirmation of approval of the "Contributor responsibilities" section of the pull request form.
* **Any contributions intentionally sent upstream are presumed to be offered under the terms of the OSI-approved [LGPL v2.1 License].**
